## Sensitivity Analysis and Model Evaluation Summary Based on Real Data

### Q1 Bayesian Model (Empirical Bootstrap Analysis)
1. **Confidence Distribution**: Bootstrap 95% CI calculated from 2216 valid samples
2. **Explanation Rate Analysis**: 95% CI calculated by rule system
3. **Stability Analysis**: Temporal consistency analysis by season

### Q2 Rule System (Statistical Significance Tests)
1. **Chi-square Test**: Test independence between rule system and outcome flips
2. **Confidence Intervals**: Wilson CI for flip rates by rule system
3. **Robustness**: Consistency analysis across seasons

### Q3 Clustering (Bootstrap Robustness)
1. **Clustering Stability**: Bootstrap-based Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) calculation
2. **Assumption Validation**: Age linearity, growth trajectory ANOVA tests

### Q4 DTPM Backtesting
1. **Parameter Sensitivity**: Real backtesting analysis of parameter effects
2. **Pareto Frontier**: Optimal balance between fairness and entertainment
